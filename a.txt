Manager Review
End of Year Review (against objectives)
Mukesh has had a very strong year. In regard to his objectives, all have been achieved where this was possible. Some objectives are ongoing due to the nature and volume of the work involved and, in those cases, excellent progress has been made. From where we were at the start of FY24 to where we are now, the changes that Mukesh has implemented are huge, and have had a significant positive impact. We now have a much more structured, industry standard approach to development, following proven methodologies.

The implementation of agile processes and software development best practices have not only allowed us to pass our audit for ISO, but have also helped to engage and focus the members of the team and allowed them to grow as developers. The ease with which these changes have been embraced are testament to Mukesh's approach; thorough, calm, hard working and diligent, and with an ability to explain technical detail to people of varying knowledge and experience.

Mukesh is always willing to take on new tasks and is very self sufficient, but also knows when there is a need to question or involve other people.
I think that Mukesh and I have a very good working relationship and I look forward to it continuing and developing over the coming year. He is a valuable member of the team and the wider business and will play in an important role as the business continues to grow and we look at ways of improving efficiencies and introducing new technologies as part of that growth.

Behaviour against Company Values
Mukesh acts in accordance with the company values in all work that he does. His clients are internal, and he always displays a Client First attitude when approaching a piece of work, giving clear explanation to all, including those who don't have a technical background. The changes that he has made to our procedures demonstrate a Outcomes Driven and Forward Thinking approach, and he has run various training sessions across Service Management, because we are Collectively Confident..
