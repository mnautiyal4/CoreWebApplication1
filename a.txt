Solutions
1. Two different difnition of KPemp

a. Evolution of an employee’s and organisation’s Knowledge Profile (KP) over a certain duration:

KPemp <- [U k/CYB]t
Where : t = duration (in year/months - For example year x to y)

b. Current validity and relevance of an employee's knowledge at a particular point in time:

KPemp <- [U k/CYB]C

Where:

'C' = Currency of the knowledge, defined as follows:

C = Validity Period Remaining / Total Validity Period

Here, 'Validity Period Remaining' would be the time left before a certification, training or experience becomes outdated or irrelevant. 'Total Validity Period' is the entire span for which a certification, training or experience is considered valid or relevant.

In this case, a value of 'C' closer to 1 would indicate that the knowledge is highly current (recently acquired or still very relevant), while a value closer to 0 would indicate that the knowledge is less current (acquired long ago or becoming less relevant).

2. Combine into one formula

We need to represent the Knowledge Profile of an employee (KPemp), which includes the knowledge (k) from the CYBOK body of knowledge, the duration (t) of that knowledge, and the currency (C) of that knowledge.

For each knowledge unit (k), there exists a duration (t) and a currency (C). We can represent this as a function F:

F: K -> (T, C)

Then, the Knowledge Profile of an employee (KPemp) can be represented as a set of all such functions for all knowledge units (k) in CYBOK:

KPemp = { F(k) | k ∈ CYBOK }

This way, for each knowledge unit in CYBOK, we have a corresponding pair (t, C) representing the duration and currency of that knowledge unit in the employee's knowledge profile.
